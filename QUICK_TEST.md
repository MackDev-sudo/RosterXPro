# Quick Test - Comp-off Carry Forward

## Current Status

âœ… **Fixed**: The system now uses local calculation only (no database calls)

## Test Steps

### 1. **Check Current Month (July 2025)**

- Look at the Comp-off Balance card
- Should show: **2** (carry forward)
- Debug info should show: `CF=2, Local=2, Total=4, Month=7`

### 2. **Navigate to August 2025**

- Click the **right arrow** next to "July 2025"
- Month should change to "August 2025"
- Comp-off Balance should now show: **3** (carry forward)
- Debug info should show: `CF=3, Local=2, Total=5, Month=8`

### 3. **Navigate to September 2025**

- Click the **right arrow** again
- Month should change to "September 2025"
- Comp-off Balance should now show: **4** (carry forward)
- Debug info should show: `CF=4, Local=2, Total=6, Month=9`

## Expected Results

| Month          | Carry Forward | Total Balance |
| -------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| July 2025      | 2             | 4             |
| August 2025    | 3             | 5             |
| September 2025 | 4             | 6             |

## Console Logs to Verify

You should see these messages when navigating:

```
calculateLocalCarryForward called with month: 8, year: 2025
Local calculation: Month 8/2025, carry forward = 3
Immediate local carry forward: 3
```

## If It's Still Not Working

1. **Refresh the page** completely
2. **Check console logs** for the messages above
3. **Verify debug display** shows the correct values
4. **Try navigating** between months using the arrows

The system should now work correctly and show the proper carry forward values!
