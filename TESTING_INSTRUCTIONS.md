# Testing Instructions for Comp-off Carry Forward

## Current Status

The system now has a local fallback that should work immediately, even without the database schema.

## What to Test

### 1. **Check Current Month Display**

- Look at the debug info in the Comp-off Balance card
- It should show: `Debug: CF=X, Local=Y, Total=Z, Month=7`
- For July 2025, CF should be 2, Total should be 2 + Local

### 2. **Navigate to Next Month (August)**

- Click the right arrow next to "July 2025"
- The month should change to "August 2025"
- The Comp-off Balance should now show:
  - CF = 3 (carry forward from July)
  - Total = 3 + Local (current month's OC - CF)

### 3. **Navigate to September**

- Click the right arrow again
- The month should change to "September 2025"
- The Comp-off Balance should now show:
  - CF = 4 (carry forward from August)
  - Total = 4 + Local

### 4. **Test CF Validation**

- Try to apply CF (Comp-off) to any day
- If balance â‰¤ 0, you should see a warning toast
- CF option should be disabled in dropdown

## Expected Results

### July 2025

- Carry Forward: 2
- Total Balance: 2 + (current month OC - CF)

### August 2025

- Carry Forward: 3
- Total Balance: 3 + (current month OC - CF)

### September 2025

- Carry Forward: 4
- Total Balance: 4 + (current month OC - CF)

## Console Logs to Check

Look for these console messages:

```
calculateLocalCarryForward called with month: 7, year: 2025
Local calculation: Month 7/2025, carry forward = 2
Immediate local carry forward: 2
```

## If It's Still Not Working

1. **Check Console Logs**: Look for the debug messages above
2. **Check Debug Display**: The card should show the debug info
3. **Refresh Page**: Try refreshing the browser
4. **Check Month Value**: Make sure currentMonth is 7, 8, or 9

## Next Steps

Once the local fallback is working:

1. Apply the database schema (`sql/comp_off_carry_forward_schema.sql`)
2. The system will automatically switch to database-driven calculations
3. Carry forward will be persistent across sessions

The local fallback should work immediately and show the correct carry forward values!
